This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user inputs.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where an attempt is made to parse a user ID as an integer without validating it.  If the ID is not an integer, this will lead to a runtime error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.
